Note for the SSD Tray, its meant to hold an SSD with (2) M3x6 Screws and (2) tabs that are printed into the model. Screws are located on the right side of the SSD for easy access.
The CPU/GPU bracket is a modified version of ACE CONSOLE REPAIR'S bracket. It's been slightly modified to fit with my fan shroud on 1.6 boards.
1.4GHz Fan Shrouds are designed around having the HD+ HDMI mod.
Parts are drawn/exported in Inches so if you are using software thats metric, you may need to scale the model.
The fan shrouds with a space for a GPU fan are intended to fit a 40mm fan on top. Noctura is what I have and using their included rubber mounts work well.
Ideally these fan shrouds are used with a USBC PSU. They block off air flow to the PSU that the exhuast fan provides. Adding an air intake fan should help with this.
I have not seen any heat related issues on my personal console with a stock PSU so far but I intend on using a USBC-PSU in the future.
I have modified the SSD Tray so now it will also fit a 2.5" HDD.

Note for the SSD Tray, its meant to hold an SSD with (2) M3x6 Screws and (2) tabs that are printed into the model. Screws are located on the right side of the SSD for easy access.
The CPU/GPU bracket is a modified version of ACE CONSOLE REPAIR'S bracket. It's been slightly modified to fit with my fan shroud on 1.6 boards.
